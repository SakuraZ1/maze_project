# Overview 

The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Maze Generator and Solver application using OCaml. The application will enable users to generate mazes of varing sizes and complexities, visualize them, and solve them using different algorithms. 

Key Features:
  - Maze Generation:
     - Implement multiple maze generation algorithms
        - Recursive Backtracking
        - Prim's Algorithm
        - Kruskal's Algorithm
