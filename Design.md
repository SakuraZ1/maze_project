# Maze Game

## Overview
The project allows users to interact and learn algorithms from maze.
Users can choose which algorithm to generate the maze, try to find the path between the start point and the goal.
Also, they can compare solutions which generated by different algorithms for study.

Key Features:

Maze Generation:
     - Implement multiple maze generation algorithms
          - Recursive Backtracking
          - Prim's Algorithm
          - Kruskal's Algorithm

Maze Solve:
     - Implement multiple maze solver algorithms
           - BFS 
           - A-star search

## Mock
The Maze Game will have a GUI for users:
```
Maze Page ("/"):
    click "Generate" button to choose an algorithm to generate a random maze
    click "Up", "Down", "Left", "Right" button to move the charactor
        if the character reach the end, users can choose regenerate or see solutions
    click "solutions" button to choose the solving algorithm
        users can see the solution generated by the chosen algorithm
        the path of the solution will be visible on the screen
```
